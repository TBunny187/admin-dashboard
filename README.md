# admin-dashboard

Page completed to the best of my current abilities.
I will keep this to continue to tinker with at a later time, also
as a reminder of how to semi-efficiently set up a grid layout.

There are a few things I don't entirely like about the setup,
but that's something I will have to come back to later on, and
mess around with some more, to really solidify my knowlege.

But, for now, the basic layout is a lot more than I was able to do
just 2 weeks ago, and I'm quite happy with it.

As I continue to learn and grow, I will likely come back
and tinker with this, as I said, to make it even better.
